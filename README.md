# cpp_template_repo
Small repository for training purposes (C++)


This repo is created for training purposes and gives you a basic skeleton for C++ programs. <br> 
It consists of the main.cpp file as a starting point and .json files that give VS code and compilers GCC, Clang and MSVC information about how the files in this repo should be compiled.
The resulting .exe file will be named "rooster.exe" after you compile the file.
